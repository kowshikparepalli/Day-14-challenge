This C program is designed to manage a Smart Hotel Room Booking and Billing System for multiple customers.
It calculates each customer's room charges, service charges, discounts, GST, and the final bill, and finally prints a hotel summary report with total rooms booked, total revenue, and the highest and lowest bills of the day.
Includes the standard input/output header file so the program can use printf() and scanf().
customers → number of customers.
room_type → the type of room chosen (1, 2, or 3).
num_days → number of days the customer stays.
total_rooms → keeps track of total rooms booked.
i → loop counter for each customer.
rate → cost per night for selected room.
base_fare → room cost for all days (rate × num_days).
add_services → cost for optional services (breakfast, Wi-Fi, gym).
sub_total → total before tax (base_fare + services - discount).
discount → 10% discount if subtotal > ₹10,000.
gst → 12% Goods and Services Tax.
final_bill → total after adding GST.
total_revenue → total money earned from all customers.
highest_bill → the maximum bill of the day.
lowest_bill → initialized with a large value (so the first real bill replaces it).
